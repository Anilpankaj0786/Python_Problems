# Question1: Given a list of numbers, remove all duplicate values and return the unique elements.
# a=[]
# size=int(input("enter a size"))
# for i in range(size):
#     val=int(input("enter a val"))
#     a.append(val)
# print(a)
# b=set(a)
# print(b)

# Question2: Given two sets, find the common elements between them.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={3,4,5,6}
# a=a.intersection(b)
# print(a)



# Question3: Given two sets, find elements that are unique to each set.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={3,4,5,6}
# print(a^b)

# Question4: Given two sets, return elements that are only in the first set.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={3,4,5,6}
# print(a-b)

# Question4: Given two sets, return elements that are only in the second set.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={3,4,5,6}
# print(b-a)

# Question5: Given two sets, check if the first set is a subset of the second.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={1,2}
# print(b.issubset(a))


# Question6: Given multiple sets, return a single set that contains all unique elements.
# a={1,2,3,4}
# b={3,4,5,6}
# c={5,6,7,8}
# d=a.union(b)
# e=d.union(c)
# print(e)
